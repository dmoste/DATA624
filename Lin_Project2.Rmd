```{r}
# Import libraries
library(mice)
library(VIM)
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# Load data
to_model <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lincarrieli/Data624/main/StudentData%20-%20TO%20MODEL.csv")

rename(to_model, Brand.Code = Ã¯..Brand.Code)

to_predict <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lincarrieli/Data624/main/StudentEvaluation-%20TO%20PREDICT.csv")
```


```{r}
#summary(to_model)
```


### Data Processing
```{r}
# Compute missing values in each column
colSums(is.na(to_model))

# Check number of unique values in Brand.Code column
table(to_model$Brand.Code)
```


```{r}
# Assign empty Brand Codes as "A"
to_model$Brand.Code[to_model$Brand.Code == ""] <- "A"
```

```{r}
library(plyr)
# Converting Brand.Code to numbers
to_model[,1] <- mapvalues(to_model[,1],
                                  from = c("A","B","C","D"),
                                  to = c(1,2,3,4))
to_model[,1] <- as.integer(to_model[,1])
```

```{r}
# Remove response column pH
df1 <- to_model[, -which(names(to_model) %in% 'PH')]
```

```{r}
# Impute missing data with mean
NA2mean <- function(x) replace(x, is.na(x), mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
df1[] <- lapply(df1, NA2mean)
```


### Visualize distribution of predictive variables
```{r}
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
d <- melt(df1)
ggplot(d,aes(x = value)) + 
    facet_wrap(~variable,scales = "free_x") + 
    geom_histogram()
```

### Transformation
It's important to normalize the data before training for Neural Network analysis.
A standard approach is to scale the inputs to have mean 0 and a variance. Also linear decorrelation/whitening/pca helps a lot.

```{r}
# Center and scale data
library(caret)
trans <- preProcess(df1,
                    method = c("center", "scale"))
transformed_df <- predict(trans, df1)

# Get predictors with near zero variance
nzv <- nearZeroVar(transformed_df, saveMetrics = TRUE)
nzv[nzv[,"nzv"] == TRUE,]
```

```{r}
# Drop Hyd.Pressure1
drops <- c("Hyd.Pressure1")
transformed_df <- transformed_df[,!(names(transformed_df) %in% drops)]
```


```{r}
# Get highly correlated variables and drop them
higlyCorrelated <- findCorrelation(cor(transformed_df), cutoff = .75)
processed <- transformed_df[, -higlyCorrelated]
```

```{r}
# Add PH back to dataset
processed <- cbind(to_model[,"PH"], processed)
names(processed)[1] <- ("PH")
```

```{r}
# Drop rows with missing PH
processed <- processed[complete.cases(processed),]
```

### Building a Neural Network model
```{r}
#Split data into train and test
set.seed(12345)
train_ind <- sample(seq_len(nrow(processed)),
                    size = floor(0.75*nrow(processed)))

train <- processed[train_ind,]
test <- processed[-train_ind,]
```


```{r}
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "cv", 
                           number = 10)

nnetGrid <-  expand.grid(.decay = c(0.5, 0.1),                          
                         .size = c(5,6,7))

nnetFit <- train(train[,-1],
                 train[,1],
                 method = "nnet",
                 maxit = 500,
                 trace = F,
                 linout = 1,
                 trControl = fitControl,
                 tuneGrid = nnetGrid,
                 MaxNWts = 10 * (ncol(train) + 1) + 10 + 1)
```


```{r}
nnetTune <- nnet(train[,-1],
                 train[,1],
                 size = 4,
                 linout = TRUE,
                 decay = 0,
                 maxit = 100,
                 MaxNWts = 10*(ncol(train)+1)+10+1) 
```

```{r}
nnetPred <- predict(nnetTune, test[,-1])
```


```{r}
RMSE(test$PH, nnetPred)
mean(abs((test$PH-nnetPred)/test$PH)) * 10
```

```{r}
library(MLmetrics)
MAPE(nnetPred, test$PH)
```



### Selecting variables for Neural Network models
I will follow the three main points for selecting input variables.
(i) the number of available variables, which may be very large
(ii) correlations between potential input variables, which creates redundancy and
(iii) variables that have little or no predictive power.


There is no fixed rule as to how many layers and neurons to use. As far as the number of neurons is concerned, it should be between the input layer size and the output layer size, usually 2/3 of the input size.
